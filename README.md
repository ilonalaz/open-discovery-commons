# Open Discovery Commons (ODC)

**Status:** Draft v0.1  
**Purpose:** Public discussion and critique  
**License:** CC BY-SA 4.0  

Open Discovery Commons (ODC) is an early proposal for an **open, neutral, AI-readable discovery commons** for local businesses and services.

The goal is to enable AI systems to recommend businesses based on **facts, relevance, and trust**, rather than advertising, SEO manipulation, or platform-controlled ranking.

This repository contains a **working draft**, not a finished system.


## What this is

- A proposal for a public discovery standard
- AI-first, machine-readable by design
- Neutral and non-commercial at the core
- Intended as a shared digital commons


## What this is not

- Not a startup or company
- Not a search engine
- Not an advertising platform
- Not a replacement for business websites
- Not owned by any single entity


## Current scope

- Local businesses and services
- City-by-city, human-scale adoption
- Focus on factual description and trust signals
- Discovery without paid visibility


## The draft

The actual proposal lives here:

➡️ **[`/drafts/ODC-Draft-v0.1.md`](./drafts/ODC-Draft-v0.1.md)**

That document contains:
- the problem statement
- core principles
- the business profile concept
- governance ideas
- open questions


## Contributing

This is an early draft.

Feedback, critique, and alternative perspectives are welcome.
Please use **Issues** to point out:
- unclear parts
- missing concerns
- governance risks
- misunderstandings

There is no roadmap and no commitment to implementation.


## Origin

This project was initiated as a response to the shift from
human-driven web discovery to AI-mediated discovery.

The intention is to explore whether discovery can remain fair,
neutral, and trustworthy in an AI-first environment.
